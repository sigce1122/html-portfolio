<h1> Top Bollywood Movie Recomdations according to Vaishnavi</h1>
<h2> Here are my all time favourite pics for a perfect movie night!</h2>

<hr />

<h3> Ye Jawani Hai Deewani</h3>
<p> The movie is all about the frienship that we cherrish for lifetime.The movie has a special scenic view of a friends reunion trip to Manali,India and a cute rom-com love story.</p>

<h3> 3 idiots </h3>
<p> This has to be in top 3 because the movie is all about the 'Engineers'. A story of three engineers,how they met and became friends to the final journey of achieving sucsess in their respective fields rather than being just Engineer .The best comedy film I have watched so far.

<h3> Raazi </h3>
<p> The story of an indian spy who gets married to a pakistani army major to save the nation. Perfect movie showing that how sacrifies of these military make us sleep peacefully.</p>
